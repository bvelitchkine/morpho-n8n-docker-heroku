# morpho-n8n-docker-heroku

This is a [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)-focused container implementation of [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

Use the **Deploy to Heroku** button above to launch n8n on Heroku. When deploying, make sure to check all configuration options and adjust them to your needs. It's especially important to set `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a random secure value.

Refer to the [Heroku n8n tutorial](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/server-setups/heroku/) for more information.

If you have questions after trying the tutorials, check out the [forums](https://community.n8n.io/).
